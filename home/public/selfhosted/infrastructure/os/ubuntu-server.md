# Ubuntu Server Configuration Overview
## Purpose

[Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (64-bit)](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) is the primary operating system powering all Raspberry Pi and Mini-PC nodes in the homelab.
It provides a stable, secure, and lightweight base ideal for Kubernetes (K3s), Docker, and automated provisioning via Ansible.

The focus is on **long-term reliability, security hardening, and minimal overhead** — ensuring each node runs efficiently and consistently within the cluster.

## 1. Rationale for Choosing Ubuntu Server
### Proven Stability

Ubuntu’s LTS (Long-Term Support) releases offer five years of security updates and kernel support, making it well-suited for persistent, unattended systems.

### Wide Ecosystem

Ubuntu’s compatibility with cloud, container, and DevOps tooling (Docker, K3s, Ansible, Helm, Trivy, etc.) ensures seamless integration with modern infrastructure.

### Active Community

Extensive documentation, tutorials, and an active community make Ubuntu one of the most accessible platforms for maintenance and troubleshooting.

## 2. Installation and Base Configuration
Each node is installed with a minimal image to reduce resource usage and attack surface.

### Initial Setup Checklist
* Select Minimal Installation (no desktop environment)
* Create a non-root user with sudo privileges
* Enable OpenSSH for remote access

## 3. Security and Hardening Practices

Ubuntu nodes follow a least-privilege and defense-in-depth model to comply with cluster-wide security baselines.

### Core Configuration Principles
* Non-root operation — Applications run under limited users or service accounts
* UFW firewall — Default deny inbound, allow required ports only
* SSH hardening — Key-based login only, root login disabled
* Kernel hardening — Apply sysctl and seccomp restrictions
* Automated upgrades — Unattended package and security patching

## 4. Integration with Cluster and Automation

All nodes are configured for Ansible-based provisioning, allowing updates, package installs, and configuration changes to propagate automatically.

Ubuntu’s consistent package management and service control (systemd) make it ideal for automation across heterogeneous hardware such as Raspberry Pis and x86 mini-PCs.

## 5. Maintenance and Lifecycle
* **Patch cadence**: Weekly automatic security updates
* **Manual upgrades**: Major version bumps every 2–3 years (LTS-to-LTS)
* **Monitoring**: Logs via journalctl, system metrics via K3s/Prometheus
* **Recovery**: Nodes can be reimaged and rejoined via automated bootstrap scripts

## Summary

Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS provides a robust, predictable, and secure base layer for the homelab’s Kubernetes and container infrastructure.
Its combination of community support, strong security defaults, and ecosystem compatibility makes it the ideal choice for a long-term, maintainable cluster foundation.
