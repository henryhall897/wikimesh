# WikiMesh

**WikiMesh** is a **federated, decentralized wiki network mesh** designed to promote the sharing and preservation of technical knowledge across independently operated Wiki.js instances.  

Each node in the network—whether personal, organizational, or community-driven—maintains its own repository of documentation while remaining connected through a shared Git-based federation. Contributors can publish guides, infrastructure knowledge, and self-hosting documentation that others can pull, merge, or extend within their own wikis.

## How Federation Works

WikiMesh isn’t a single centralized wiki.  
Instead, it’s a **collection of autonomous wikis** that share a common structure and philosophy:

- **Autonomy:** Each contributor runs their own instance and domain, controlling access, visibility, and content.  
- **Collaboration:** Articles can be synced through Git remotes or federated merges, allowing knowledge to spread without a central authority.  
- **Persistence:** Every wiki node acts as a peer, preserving shared knowledge even if one node goes offline.  
- **Transparency:** Contributions and authorship are tracked through version control, ensuring attribution and trust.  

In short, **WikiMesh** is like a distributed library — each node maintains its own collection, but all can contribute to the same knowledge ecosystem.

## Structure
**WikiMesh** Primarily focuses on self hosted projects by contributors to create a wide network of information greater than any one person can gather by themselves. 
Knowledge in **WikiMesh** is organized into consistent categories:

- **Selfhosted:** Documentation and guides for running your own apps and services.  
	- **Infrastructure:** Foundational technologies that power self-hosted systems, such as Kubernetes, networking, and security.  
	- **Applications:** Walkthroughs for deploying or integrating tools like Firefly III, Wiki.js, and Jellyfin.  

This structure keeps knowledge modular, reusable, and easy to federate between different contributors’ wikis.

## Philosophy

WikiMesh aims to build a **collective knowledge mesh**, not a hierarchy.  
Each contributor is a node in the network — free to fork, extend, or contribute back.  
The goal is to make knowledge **durable, decentralized, and personally owned**, while remaining open to collaboration.

> “Knowledge grows stronger when it’s shared, not stored.”
